## Day8:Python Essentials for Data Analytics and Data Science

* File Handling:Learned how to read and write data from text and CSV files using 
* the open() function, along with file modes (r, w, a).
* Exception Handling: Practiced handling runtime errors using try, except, and finally blocks to make programs more robust.
* List Comprehension: Created compact one-line loops for list creation and filtering, improving code readability and efficiency.



### Conclusion

This Python learning journey covers all the essential topics — from basic syntax and data structures to functions, modules, and error handling —
 -providing a strong foundation for both Data Analytics and Data Science.
By completing these 8 days of Python practice, I’ve built the necessary programming skills to confidently move forward with libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib, which are crucial for data manipulation, analysis, and visualization.
This marks the transition from core Python programming to the analytical and scientific application stage of my learning path.
